# Super market billing software

Here we deploy OOPS and file handling for accepting and storing a customer's data, commit changes to it, delete it and modify it.

The software also stores the data of items purchased by a specific customer separately and every time a customer makes a transaction, it produces a valid bill, just like a good billing software.

It also counts the number of times a customer visited and allots them points. At a certain points, it gives a certain discount on their total transaction.
